[![platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-Node--RED-red)](https://nodered.org)
[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/node-red%2Fnode-red.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/node-red%2Fnode-red)

The Node-RED graphical wiring tool for Low-code programming of event-driven applications.
Packaged as a Core18 based Ubuntu Snap, intended for multiple architectures.

Listens on port 1881 and runs as as service in strict mode by default.
Fully configurable on port 1882: edit settings.js directly from a webpage!

### Modification

When installed as a Snap package, it will run in a secure container that does
not have access to any external facilities that may be needed for you to use, such as:

 - You cannot install extra nodes that require natively compiled code as the build tools are not built in.
 - You cannot use projects mode as that requires comman line access to git and that is also not built in.
 - access to the main system storage/disk
 - `gcc` - needed to compile any binary components of nodes you want to install
 - `git` - needed if you want to use the Projects feature
 - direct access to gpio hardware
 - access to any external commands your flows want to use with the Exec node (for example).

You may be able relax this by installing the snap in `--classic` mode but this is not advised, and Canonical have tightened the scope recently and this may no longer be possible unless in development mode.

**ping**: If you want to use the ping node you must manually connect the network-observe interface.

    sudo snap connect node-red:network-observe


#### Installing

    snap install node-red

When the snap is running you can view the Node-RED log using

    journalctl -f -u snap.node-red*

You can also stop and restart the application by

    snap disable node-red
    snap enable node-red

Currently the ONLY serial support is for /dev/ttyS0 style ports.
USB serial ports (hot-pluggable) are not yet supported by Snap.


#### Configuration

The **settings.js** and **flows.json** file are located in the `/root/snap/node-red/current/` directory.
If you do need to read and write files - this is the only directory path you will have access to from outside
the secure container.

**Note:** The path to the flows file is currently fixed to `flows.json` in [start.sh](nodered.snap/blob/master/snap/local/settings/start.sh) and therefore cannot be changed in `settings.js`.

To install any extra nodes, the best option is to use the Manage Palette option in the editor.
To install via the command line you can

    sudo su -
    cd /root/snap/node-red/current/
    node-red.npm i --unsafe-perm node-red-contrib-my-great-node-name
    snap restart node-red

The base port can be set by the `$PORT` environment variable, or in the `settings.js` file.


#### Building
   
    sudo snap install multipass
    sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
    snapcraft
